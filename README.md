# BTC API Server

N. P. O'Donnell, 2021

## Introduction

This is my first rust project and the main goal is helping me to learn rust. But it should do something useful too and I've always felt the need for a general-purpose **private** API server which I can use to get bitcoin blockchain data and price data. This API server builds on [bitcoin core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin).
